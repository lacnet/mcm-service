		<h2>Munchkin Rules Breakdown</h2>
			<div class="entry">
				<p>by: Shane Phillips<br>
version: 3.0</p>
<h3>General</h3>
<ul>
<li>Instructions on the cards always override the general rules. Be
sure to read each card and apply any rule modifications where
applicable.</li>
<li>The owner of the game has final say in all disputes.</li>
<li>The <strong>minimum character level is 1</strong>. At level 1, all “Go down a Level!” cards and effects are discarded and ignored.</li>
<li>The <strong>maximum character level is 10</strong>. At level 10,
all “Go up a Level!” cards and effects are discarded and ignored,
except if you are a Cleric and get Divine Intervention then you win the
game.</li>
<li>The statute of limitations on cheating or rule breaking is 2.6 seconds. (Inferred)</li>
<li>If you have no cards in your hand, you cannot discard you whole hand.</li>
<li>You may play Curse Cards at any time on any player.</li>
<li>You may show your hand to other players.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Game Setup</h3>
<ul>
<li>Every character is a Level 1 Human with no Class and is dealt 2 cards from the Dungeon Draw pile and the Treasure Draw pile.</li>
<li>The character’s sex is the same as the player’s.</li>
<li>Everyone rolls a d6, highest roll goes first.</li>
<li>Turn progression is clockwise</li>
<li>Discarded Cards go to their respective discard pile</li>
<li>If all cards are drawn, shuffle the discard pile and use that.  If there are no discards then no one can draw that kind of card.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Items &amp; Equipment</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cards in your hand are not in play and do not count until played.</li>
<li>Equipment played to the table becomes a Carried Item.</li>
<li>You may play an item at any time during your turn.</li>
<li>Carried Items cannot be returned to your hand.  You can only get rid of Carried Items by discarding, trading, or Bribing.</li>
<li>You can discard an item at any time. (Inferred)</li>
<li>Single use items can be played from your hand or in play and are discarded after use.</li>
<li>You can have any number of items or equipment on the table as
Carried Items, but you can only have one Big Item as a Carried Item at
any one time.</li>
<li>You may only Equip one body specific Carried Item at a time (ex: 2
one handed items OR 1 Two-handed item). Some items have restrictions
and cannot be equipped by certain races/classes. Equipped Items are
still Carried Items.</li>
<li>Only Equipped Items can give you a bonus in Combat.  Indicate non-equipped Carried Items by turning the card sideways.</li>
<li>During your turn you may sell Carried Items or items from your hand
for their value. For every thousand gold you gain 1 level. Left over
gold is lost. Sold items are discarded.</li>
<li>Equipment may be played during your turn (Phase 1, 2, &amp; 5), but not in during Combat.</li>
<li>You may Trade Carried Items at any time, except Combat. Any traded items must go directly to the table and become Carried Items.</li>
<li>You may try to bribe any player at any time to do what you want by
giving them a Carried Item. That item must be played to the table and
become a Carried Item.</li>
<li>If a Curse can apply to more than one Carried Item, the victim chooses which item.</li>
<li>You many only trade Items and Equipment.  You cannot trade other cards.  You cannot trade cards from your hand.</li>
<li>You may try to gain favors by giving Equipped or Carried Items to other players.  Also known as a “Bribe”.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hirelings</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can play a Hireling at any time, even in combat.</li>
<li>You can only have one Hireling in play at any time.</li>
<li>You may discard a Hireling at any time.</li>
<li>A Hireling is NOT and Item, unless it has a price on it.</li>
<li>You may only trade Hirelings that have a Gold Price value.</li>
<li>Hirelings that give you extra hands or let you carry an extra Big
Item do not actually carry the item(s). Therefore, if something happens
to the Hireling it does not affect your items. Other Hirelings carry
and use Items themselves and therefore those items are affected by
Traps, Curses, and Bad Stuff as though you were carrying them yourself.</li>
<li>You may sacrifice your hireling to allow you to automatically escape from a monster. (Inferred)</li>
<li>If your Hireling sacrifices himself to save you, you keep his items.</li>
<li>If your Hireling is killed, you loot the body yourself and keep the items.</li>
<li>If your Hireling is taken away by a Trap, Curse, Bad Stuff, or a change in loyalty, the items he is using goes with him.</li>
<li>Monster modifiers can be used on Hirelings in play at 1/5 the
bonus. (eg. +5 = +1) Negative monster modifiers may not be played on a
Hireling unless it already has a positive modifier on it.</li>
<li>Hirelings activate Monster Bonuses.</li>
<li>Hirelings are not affected by Bad Stuff, unless otherwise stated.</li>
<li>Ignore you Hirelings race, class, and gender when determining what a monster does to YOU.</li>
<li>A Hireling is the gender as described/illustrated on the card.
Either Male, Female, or Neutral. (Robots are Neutral, Ralph the Wonder
Dog use to be Male but we took him to the vet and is now Neutral)</li>
<li>The gender of a Hireling is only used with Monster Bonuses and Item restrictions.</li>
<li>No power in Heaven or on Earth will let the Budget Hireling carry anything.  Not even the Cheat card.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steeds</h3>
<ul>
<li>You may discard your Steed at any time.</li>
<li>A Player may only have one Steed at a time in play.</li>
<li>Steeds are Big items, but they carry themselves and do not count against you.</li>
<li>Monster modifiers can be used on Steeds in play at 1/5 the bonus.
(eg. +5 = +1) Negative monster modifiers may not be played on a Steed
unless it already has a positive modifier on it.</li>
<li>Steeds cannot use items.</li>
<li>Item Enhancement cards cannot be used on Steed-enhancing items.</li>
<li>Steed bonus or penalty to Run Away replaces your bonus or penalty.</li>
<li>A player that draws a face up Steed in the “Open a Door” phase may
choose to fight it as a Monster. If you do, it becomes a Monster with a
level equal to twice the combat bonus. Defeating it is good for one
Level and one Treasure. It’s Bad Stuff is “Lose a Level”.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Basic Turn Breakdown</h2>
<ol>
<li>Pre-Door Preparation Phase - Equip, Sell, or Trade Items</li>
<li>Open A Door - Draw a card face up from the Dungeon Draw pile<br>
If you draw a:
<ul>
<li>Monster Card –&gt; You must Fight (Combat) then go to step 5, Post-Door Phase</li>
<li>Curse Card –&gt; It targets you, if possible.  Go to step 3.</li>
<li>Anything else –&gt; play it immediately OR place it in your hand. Go to step 3.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>then, you may either “Look for Trouble” OR “Loot the Room”
<ul>
<li>Look for Trouble? - You may play a monster card from your hand and fight it</li>
<li>Loot the Room - If you did not fight a monster, then draw a card face down from the Dungeon Draw pile and put it in your hand.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Post-Door Phase - Equip, Sell, or Trade Items</li>
<li>Charity - Discard down to max hand size, 5, and give the excess
cards to the lowest level player. In case of a tie, divide the cards as
evenly as possible - you decide who gets the larger share. If you are
the lowest, discard the excess cards.</li>
<li>Begin Next Players Turn</li>
</ol>
<h3>Combat</h3>
<ul>
<li>Combat begins once the monster is revealed.</li>
<li>You cannot Equip, Sell, Trade, or Steal during combat.</li>
<li>Any player may use any “useable only once” item from their hand AND/OR a Carried Item to add a bonus to any player or monster.</li>
<li>You can handle Combat in these ways:
<ol>
<li>Fight Alone
<ul>
<li>If your Level plus any bonuses (from Equipment or Items) is greater
than the Level(s) of the monster(s) plus any monster bonuses from
abilities or Items, then you are able to defeat the monster.</li>
<li>If you can defeat the monster, you must wait 2.6 seconds before
declaring the monster(s) defeated. After which you go up the level(s)
and draw the treasure(s) face down according to the Monster(s).</li>
<li>If you cannot, then you must Ask for Help or Try to Run Away.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ask for Help
<ul>
<li>You may Ask For Help from any player during combat, but only one
player can help you. You may bribe them with any Carried Items and or
any treasure cards gained by defeating the monster (decide how to do so
upon agreement to help).</li>
<li>If they agree, then they become your Helper and enter Combat. You
add their Level and bonuses to yours. If both your levels and bonuses
are greater than the monster(s) level(s) and bonuses, you must wait 2.6
seconds before declaring the monster(s) defeated. Then YOU go up a
level and draw the treasure(s) face up and distribute according to the
agreement.</li>
<li>The Helper does not gain a level if the monster is defeated.</li>
<li>If both of you cannot defeat the monster, both of you must Try to Run Away from each monster separately</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Try to Run Away
<ul>
<li>You receive no treasures and no levels.</li>
<li>Roll a d6. On a 5 or better you are successful and you discard the
monster. Repeat for each remaining monster. Otherwise, it catches you
and does the Bad Stuff indicated on the monster card.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Death</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you Die, you lose all your Treasure in play and in your hand.</li>
<li>You KEEP your Class(es), Race(es), Sex and Level.</li>
<li>Lay your hand face up on the table next to your Carried Items.</li>
<li>The remaining players Loot the Body<br>
<strong>Loot the Body</strong><br>
Starting with the player with the highest level, each player chooses
one of your cards UNTIL your corpse runs out of cards OR every living
player has taken one card. The rest are discarded. In case of a tie,
highest roll on a d6 chooses first.</li>
<li>Your new character appears instantly.  It is the next player’s turn.  You may play as normal.</li>
<li>At the beginning of your next turn, you will draw 2 cards from the Dungeon Draw pile and the Treasure Draw pile.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Winning the Game</h3>
<ul>
<li>Any player to reach level 10 by killing a monster or by using
Divine Intervention as a Cleric wins the game. Any player at level 10
that kills a monster or gets Divine Intervention as a Cleric wins the
game.</li>
<li>There can be multiple winners.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Stealing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Thieves have 2.6 seconds to announce a steal attempt of a Carried
Item that another player announced they will sell, trade, or
discard.(Inferred)</li>
<li>Thieves cannot steal an item from a players hand.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Race and Class</h3>
<ul>
<li>You may play and/or discard a Class or Race card at ANY time, even during Combat.</li>
<li>When you discard your last Race card, you are human again.</li>
<li>If you stop being a Dwarf and have more than one Big Item that is a
Carried Item, you must get rid of all but one. If it is your turn, you
may sell them. Otherwise, you must give them to the lowest level player
that can carry it. If you are the lowest level character, simply
discard them.</li>
<li>You may only be one Class and one Race at a time.</li>
<li>You can play Half-Breed at any time you have one Race. If you have
only one Race with Half-Breed, you are half that Race and half Human.
You lose Half-Breed when you have no Race cards in play.</li>
<li>When you play Super Munchkin, you must have a Class card in play
and one in hand to add to it. The second Class is played at the same
time as Super Munchkin. You lose Super Munchkin when you have no Class
cards in play.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Monsters</h3>
<ul>
<li>Each monster is a single monster, even if the name is plural.</li>
<li>All Monster Enhancement cards add together. Anything that gives a
bonus to a monster also gives a bonus to its Mate. But if there are two
separate monsters cards they do not share the bonus and the player
playing the Monster Enhancement card must choose which one gets the
bonus.</li>
</ul>
